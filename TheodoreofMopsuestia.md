1. Translated by Alphonse Mingana: With your assistance, O Lord Jesus Christ, I will
begin to write the explanation of the sacraments by the blessed Mar Theodore. Help
me, our Lord, and bring my work to completion. Amen.
2. Every prayer contains teaching of good works to any one who cares to think attentively
of duty, because we wish our works to be that which we ask in our prayer that they
should be. He who cares, therefore, for perfection and is anxious to do the things that
are pleasing to God, will pay |2 more attention to prayer than any other thing, and he
who does not care for any virtue and is not anxious to do the things that are pleasing to
God, it is clear that he will show also no interest in prayer. (Chapter 1)
3. so those who possess God in their mind and are very anxious to do the things that
please Him are wont to make use of frequent prayers, because they believe that they
work and converse with Him when they pray. (Chapter 1)
4. He made use of these short words as if to say that prayer does not consist so much in
words as in good works, love and zeal for duty. Indeed, any one who is inclined to good
works, all his life must needs be in prayer, which is seen in his choice of these good
works. Prayer is by necessity connected with good works, because a thing that is not
good to be looked for is not good to be prayed for. (Chapter 1)
