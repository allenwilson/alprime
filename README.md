<h1>AL Prime: Vol. I </h1>

A codex is composed of many books, a book is composed of one volume. And a codex is so called, by transference, from the trunks (codicibus) of trees or vines, as if it were a trunk because it contains a multitude of books coming out of itself like so many branches; a volume (volumen) is so called from "to roll up" (volvere). - Hugh of St. Victor, Didascalicon Ch. 16

AL Prime is a membership program that gives readers access to history, literature, philosophy, and theology of the public domain variety (i.e. old). AL Prime is a no-brainer for those heavily invested in the ecosystem of the Western tradition.

Why is it a no-brainer? Because it is free and you don't have to join anything. Take and read.

Education is the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another. - G.K. Chesterton
